        <h3> Everwild </h3>

        <p>Everwild has been a huge part of my musical life. Along with colleagues Matt Clarke, Rosie Weiss, Max Schwartz, Philip Capuzzi, and Andrew Tinch, we strive to create a concert experience which invites constructive self-reflection, a rarity in today’s technology-soaked world. We do this through juxtaposing folk and acoustic influences, which draw our audience in to feel at home and comfortable, with avant-garde influences, which evoke a more visceral reaction, guiding our audience towards their deepest emotions. We encourage our audience to plunge inward while our music conveys the process of reflection, working through pain and discomfort on the path to optimism and newfound clarity. Our audience will come away from our music feeling renewed, more confident in dealing with their lives, and more in touch with themselves.</p>

        <p>Through collaboration in Everwild, I've gained experience in some of the many aspects of being a member of a musical group. We’ve built up a strong portfolio of original music (almost all of which has been greatly shaped by the incredible Matt Clarke) reflecting our unique points of view. Composition was something new to me; I grew up with a strongly performance-centric training, but I started trying it out with the support of my bandmates, and I plan to keep working at it. So far, I have written some short interludes, an arrangement of the Tennessee Waltz and an original song entitled Snowglobe (the latter two actually feature me singing and playing ukulele)! Together, we’ve also explored group improvisation, which terrified me at first, but has improved my musicianship tenfold, as well as allowing my enjoyment and understanding of music to blossom more than I could ever explain.</p>

        <p>Outside of performance and composition, I have served as the social media coordinator and secretary, overseeing our multi-platform media presence and branding, as well as facilitating band goings-on from operating our group calendar to taking meeting notes to keeping all files organized and easily accessible. It’s been an eye-opening experience seeing how much outside of the music goes into developing a chamber ensemble, but I have found that I enjoy it almost as much as performing.<p>

        <h3>Triple-A Trio</h3>

        <p>One of the greatest joys of being a musician is collaborating with your friends and creating art. I’ve been so lucky to perform in a flute trio with two of my closest friends Aaron Rib and Anna Kevelson. Under the mentorship of Valerie Coleman, we have worked on some amazing music including Katherine Hoover’s <cite>Trio for Flutes</cite>, <cite>Jerusalem of Gold</cite> (arranged by Aaron!), and my quirky rewriting of <cite>Aus Liebe will mein Heiland sterben</cite> by J.S. Bach for voice, C flute, alto flute, and bass flute. We’ve spent our time together developing a rich and exciting group sound while also building our arranging skills and individual voices as creators.</p>

        <p>You can find a video of <cite>Aus Liebe</cite> <a href="recordings.html">here</a>!</p>
