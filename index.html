      <h2> a quote from one of my favorite shows</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed. Since beginning-less time, darkness thrives in the void, but always yields to purifying light." </p>
      <p>-Lion Turtle, Avatar the Last Airbender</p>
